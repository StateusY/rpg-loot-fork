# Bugs, bugs, bugs
## Crawling everywhere, the bane of programmers worldwide

- (FIXED) Hordlings multiply like the plaque
- (FIXED) Fall damage is too high for the player only
- (FIXED) Health bars are not given to Armadillos, Bogged, Camels, Creakings, and Sniffers
- (FIXED) Warden sonic booms do no damage

- [UNK] Damage resistances
- [IMPORTANT] Spider, Cave Spider, and Horse health bars stick to the newest entity (spawing wise of the listed ones)
- [MID] Blazes have ERROR health bars
- [LOW] Hoglin, piglin, and piglin brute health bars do not switch names when they convert to their zombified form
- [IMPORTANT] Shulker health bars do not move when the shulker teleports - they also disconnect from the shulker's health
- [LOW] If a mob takes damage before they are given a health bar, they die instantly
- [MID] Health can never exceed base therefore ignoring absorption
