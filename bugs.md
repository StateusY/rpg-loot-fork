## Crawling everywhere, the bane of programmers worldwide

- (FIXED) Hordlings multiply like the plaque
- (FIXED) Fall damage is too high for the player only
- Damage resistances
- (FIXED) Health bars are not given to Armadillos, Bogged, Camels, Creakings, and Sniffers
- Spider, Cave Spider, and Horse health bars stick to the newest entity (spawing wise of the listed ones)
- Blazes have ERROR health bars
- Hoglin, piglin, and piglin brute health bars do not switch names when they convert to their zombified form
- Shulker health bars do not move when the shulker teleports - they also disconnect from the shulker's health
